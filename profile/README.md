Kenji-NX is an open-source Nintendo Switch emulator, originally created by gdkchan, written in C#.
This emulator aims at providing excellent accuracy and performance, a user-friendly interface and consistent builds.
It was written from scratch and development on the project began in September 2017.
Kenji-NX is available on GitHub under the [MIT license](https://git.ryujinx.app/kenji-nx/ryujinx/-/raw/master/LICENSE.txt).

On October 1st 2024, Ryujinx was discontinued as the creator was forced to abandon the project.

This fork is not a Ryujinx revival project; it aims to be a middle ground between GreemDev's [Ryujinx](https://git.ryujinx.app/ryubing/ryujinx) fork and the more preservative [ryujinx-mirror](https://git.ryujinx.app/archive/ryujinx-mirror) fork.
It brings over many of the front-facing features from the aforementioned forks with *additional* contributions from KeatonTheBot and others.
