  Kenji-NX is an open-source Nintendo Switch emulator, originally created by gdkchan, written in C#.
  This emulator aims at providing excellent accuracy and performance, a user-friendly interface and consistent builds.
  It was written from scratch and development on the project began in September 2017.
  Kenji-NX is available on GitHub under the <a href="https://github.com/KeatonTheBot/Kenji-NX/blob/master/LICENSE.txt" target="_blank">MIT license</a>.
  <br><br>
  On October 1st 2024, Ryujinx was discontinued as the creator was forced to abandon the project.
  <br><br>
  This fork is not a Ryujinx revival project; it aims to be a middle ground between GreemDev's <a href="https://git.ryujinx.app/ryubing/ryujinx">Ryujinx</a> fork and the more preservative <a href="https://git.ryujinx.app/archive/ryujinx-mirror">ryujinx-mirror</a> fork.
  It brings over many of the front-facing features from the aforementioned forks with <i>additional</i> contributions from KeatonTheBot and others.
